              <h2 class="section-title">OVERVIEW</h2>
              <p class="section-text">
                For this project, I chose to address a problem I have personally
                experienced. The app is designed to bring together various
                holiday-related events and experiences in Canada. The target
                audiences include newcomers to Toronto, Canadian tourists
                visiting Toronto during the holidays, Toronto residents, and
                people who struggle with finding gift ideas each holiday
                season.<br /><br />

                My process involved defining the problem, identifying the
                primary audience, conducting secondary and competitive research,
                developing value proposition canvases, designing wireframes and
                moodboards, and finalizing the prototype.

            <!-- Problem Section -->
            <section id="problem">
              <h2 class="section-title">PROBLEM</h2>
              <p class="section-text">
                The problem I've chosen to address is the lack of a single
                platform that brings together holiday events and experiences.
                When a holiday season comes around, those who have lived in
                Toronto for a while likely already have their favourite spots
                and traditions. However, for newcomers, it can be isolating to
                have no connections and spend the holidays away from family
                without a clear way to socialize.<br /><br />

                416Toronto is a platform for holiday-related events and
                experiences. Instead of searching across multiple sources, users
                can find everything in one place. Moreover, it provides a space
                for immigrants to share and participate in their cultural
                traditions away from home.

              <p class="section-text">
                The target audience for this project includes newcomers to
                Toronto as the primary audience, Canadian tourists visiting the
                city during the holidays as the secondary audience, and Toronto
                residents, as well as individuals who struggle with finding gift
                ideas each holiday season, as the tertiary audiences.<br /><br />

                While it would be ideal to expand to other major cities, I
                decided to focus on developing a minimum viable product first,
                to refine the concept and better meet the needs of the users.

              <h2 class="section-title">SECONDARY RESEARCH</h2>
              <p class="section-text">
                Before conducting primary research, I did secondary research to
                understand the market and user needs. I focused on browsing
                Toronto-related communities on Reddit and Facebook to learn
                about people's holiday activities.<br /><br />

                Key findings:<br />
                - Many people ask others about holiday events happening in the
                city.<br />
                - There are questions about spending holidays on a tight
                budget.<br />
                - Users seek locations for "Instagrammable" photos.<br />
                - People ask about unique restaurants, cafes, and takeout
                options.<br />
                - Many, including students, parents, and tourists, ask about
                gift ideas, though the suggestions are general.<br />
                - Some people feel Toronto isn't great for holidays, which could
                be due to the lack of a centralized platform for events. Despite
                Toronto's large population, it seems there's a need for an
                easier way to find and share holiday activities.

                After completing secondary and competitive research, I moved on
                to summarizing all the insights. Creating a value proposition
                canvas (VPC) seemed like the right next step.<br /><br />

                Since my product targets different user groups, it made sense to
                create a separate VPC for each main segment.<br />
                Here's the first one, made for a Ukrainian immigrant Olenka.
